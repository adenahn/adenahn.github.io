<h1> <strong> Proof for why &radic;2 is Irrational </strong> </h1>
<p> For this proof, we can use proof by contradiction. </p>
<p> You have to first negate the original statement, and then work things out until you find a contradiction. If there is a contradiction, the negation of the original statement does not make logically sense, which means that the negation of the original statement is false. If the negation of something is false, then the original must be true. </p>
<p> &radic;2 is rational so it can be written in the form (p/q) where p & q are integers and q is not equal to 0. P and q also have no common factors other than 1. </p>
<p> p/q=&radic; 2 </p>
<p> p<sup>2</sup>/q<sup>2</sup>=2 </p>
<p> p<sup>2</sup>=2q<sup>2</sup> This means that p must be even, because the square root of an even square is always even. </p>
<p> (2k)<sup>2</sup>=2q<sup>2</sup> (2k represents the even integer p) </p>
<p> 4k<sup>2</sup>=2q<sup>2</sup> </p>
<p> 2k<sup>2</sup>=q<sup>2</sup> </p>
<p> q<sup>2</sup> is an even number, which means that q is even </p>
<p> p and q are both even, so this contradicts the statement that p and q have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, the statement that &radic;2 is rational must be false, which in turn means that &radic;2 must be irrational. </p>
