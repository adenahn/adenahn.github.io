<h1> <strong> Proof for why &radic;2 is irrational </strong> </h1>
<p> &radic;2 is rational so it can be written in the form (p/q) where p & q are integers and q is not equal to 0. P and q also have no common factors </p>
<p> p/q=&radic; 2 </p>
<p> p<sup>2</sup>/q<sup>2</sup>=2 </p>
<p> p<sup>2</sup>=2q<sup>2</sup> </p>
<p> p<sup>2</sup> is even </p>
<p> p and q are both even, so this contradicts the statement that p and q have no common factors. Therefore, &radic;2 is irrational </p>

<h2> <strong> Proof for why the sum of consecutive odd numbers will always equal a square </strong> </h2>
<p> The first odd number is 1 and 1<sup>2</sup> is equal to 1</p>
<p> If you assume the statement is true for a natural number k, that means the sum of the first k odd numbers is equal to k<sup>2</sup>
<p> this means that (1+3+5+....2k-1)=k<sup>2</sup> (an odd number is 2 times an integer minus 1) </p>
<p> the statement will also be true for k+1 </p>
<p> (1+3...(2k-1))+(2k+1) </p>
<p> substitute k<sup>2</sup> for (1+3...(2k-1)) and you get k<sup>2</sup>+2k+1 </p>
<p> this is the expanded form of (k+1)<sup>2</sup> which proves the statement for k+1 </p>
