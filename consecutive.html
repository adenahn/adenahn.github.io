<p> The first odd number is 1 and 1&radic;2 is equal to 1</p>
<p> If you assume the statement is true for a natural number k, that means the sum of the first k odd numbers is equal to k<sup>2</sup>
<p> this means that (1+3+5+....2k-1)=k<sup>2</sup> (an odd number is 2 times an integer minus 1) </p>
<p> the statement will also be true for k+1 </p>
<p> (1+3...(2k-1))+(2k+1) </p>
<p> substitute k<sup>2</sup> for (1+3...(2k-1)) and you get k<sup>2</sup>+2k+1 </p>
<p> this is the expanded form of (k+1)<sup>2</sup> which proves the statement for k+1 </p>
